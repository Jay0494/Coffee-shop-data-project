# ☕ Coffee Shop Sales Analysis Report  

## 📌 Project Overview  
I was hired as a **Data Analyst** to help a coffee shop review their sales performance and provide insights that could guide decision-making.  

The main tasks were:  
- Find trends of **total sales for each coffee type**  
- Identify the **top 10 customers** by contribution to sales  
- Analyze **sales across countries**  
- Calculate the **total quantity ordered for each coffee type**

- Create a **dashboard** to present findings clearly and visually

## 🛠 Data Preparation  
The dataset was provided in an Excel file with **four spreadsheets**. To make it manageable:  
- Extracted key columns and merged them into a **single table using Power Query**  
- Cleaned and standardized **dates, text, and numbers**  
- Removed duplicates  
- Created new calculated fields:  
  - `Total Sales = Quantity Sold × Unit Price`  
  - Extracted **Year** and **Month** from the Date column  
- Formatted everything into a proper **Excel table** for analysis
